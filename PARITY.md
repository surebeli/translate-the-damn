# PARITY — feature × platform status

The cross-environment to-do board (Constitution Law 3). A feature is "done" on a platform only when
its **spec entry exists** AND — for logic — its **conformance vector passes on that platform's CI**.
UI/interaction items are verified against the interaction spec + a per-platform UI check.

> **Drift report:** `python3 scripts/parity-drift.py` (`--fail-on-drift` for a CI gate, `--json` for
> machine output). It reads the declarations below — it is **not** a test run; per Law 2 each
> platform's CI vectors remain the truth. "DECLARED-ALIGNED" means the board is self-consistent.

## Notes

- ⚠️ copilot/agy on Windows are best-effort (known Windows `-p` quirks; agy falls back to gemini).
- Conformance coverage: `prompt-builder`, `ansi-stripper`, `hotkey-parser`, `config-defaults`,
  `backend-requests` (google-v2 + doubao request shapes), `pipeline-cache` — all run on Windows CI
  (150 tests). macOS/Linux add a runner over the same JSON.
- The Windows adapters currently **hardcode** the backend definitions that `spec/backends.json`
  declares; refactoring Windows to read the manifest is a tracked future task (keeps the manifest
  the single source for all platforms).
- **macOS UI consolidated to a single style.** The macOS port experimented with 7 swappable UI
  styles (`uiStyle` switch); it has been consolidated to one finalized "clean" UI (single-page
  grouped Form settings + clean glass-card popup with italic source). The `uiStyle` switch, picker,
  and the other six style implementations were removed. This was macOS-only (never a shared feature),
  so it is not a parity item; `config.general.uiStyle` stays in the schema (nil-default) for
  back-compat. Decision rationale: the UI-style review on branch `expe/202606`.
